Say that user jdoe runs

supy some_analysis.py --loop 2 --slices 2

on some computer, using the default configuration from
sites/__init__.py.  Say that there is only one analysis variation, and
so only one analysis tag.  Say the user runs over one sample
("TTbar"), which has two input files.  One job will have iSlice=0, and
the other job iSlice=1.  Say that iSlice=1 begins first.  Then it will
create the directory

/tmp/jdoe/some_analysis/tag/TTbar/2_1/

and the output files

/tmp/jdoe/some_analysis/tag/TTbar/2_1/TTbar_2_1.pickledData
/tmp/jdoe/some_analysis/tag/TTbar/2_1/TTbar_2_1_plots.root

and perhaps other output files with similar names in the same
directory.  When the job with iSlice=1 finishes looping over events,
it (or condor) will move the output files to

/tmp/jdoe/some_analysis/tag/TTbar/

(e.g., /tmp/jdoe/some_analysis/tag/TTbar/TTbar_2_1.pickledData)

When all jobs are finished, and the user merges the outputs, the files
